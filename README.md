# Python Practice M1D4

+ Write a function that uses for loop to print from 0 to 100.
+ Write a function that uses for loop to print all even number from 0 to 100.
+ Write a function that uses for loop to print all odd number from 1 to 100.
+ Write a function that accepts an int argument greater than 10. Function should print numbers counting backward from the argument until 0.
E.g. if argument entered is 12 then it should print
12
11
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
0 
+ Write a function that uses for loop to print sum of all numbers from 1 to 100

+ Write a function that asks to enter user name and age. Print out a message addressed to user that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

e.g. output:  Gurkipal, you will turn 100 years in 2086.
Hint: use input to take user name and age"
+ Take a list, say for example this one:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
"
+ Write a function that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. 
+ Take two lists, eg:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
write a function that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure program works on two lists of different sizes also.
+ Write a function that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.
